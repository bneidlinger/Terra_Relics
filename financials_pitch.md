# Terra Relics™

## Authentic Pre‑Collapse Organic Matter

### *A satire-first, narrative‑driven consumer goods company*

---

## 1. The Problem

* Modern consumers are overwhelmed by choice, data, and meaninglessness.
* Physical objects have lost narrative weight; everything is optimized, identical, and forgettable.
* Capital continues to chase *stories*, not utility — but no one admits this out loud.

**Insight:** People do not want better products. They want *better feelings about ownership*.

---

## 2. The Solution

**Terra Relics™** sells sealed bags of organic matter (leaves, soil) paired with:

* Serialized provenance
* Original lore
* Enforced scarcity
* Cultural permission to care

We do not sell dirt.
We sell *legibility* in an attention economy.

---

## 3. Product

* Core SKU: Terra Relic™ ($49.99)
* Seasonal drops (“Harvests”)
* Narrative variants (limited, premium)
* Opening the product irreversibly reduces perceived value

**Feature:** Zero functional utility
**Outcome:** Maximum interpretability

---

## 4. Why Now

* Collectibles are normalized
* Irony is a primary purchasing driver
* Sustainability language has outpaced sustainability action
* Consumers are fluent in satire but still transact

The market is ready to be gently mocked.

---

## 5. Market Opportunity

**Target Segments:**

* Collectors & irony consumers
* Corporate gifting buyers
* Sustainability‑adjacent brands
* People with disposable income and mild existential dread

**TAM:** Large (emotionally)
**SAM:** Smaller (financially)
**SOM:** Enough

---

## 6. Business Model

* Direct‑to‑consumer e‑commerce
* Scarcity‑driven drops
* High gross margins
* Minimal operational complexity

**Margins improve as seriousness decreases.**

---

## 7. Traction

* Pre‑launch interest (conceptual)
* Strong meme resonance
* Repeated question received: “Is this real?”

**Signal:** Confusion correlates with intent to purchase.

## 8. Competitive Landscape

| Category                | Example           | Weakness             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Collectibles            | Funko, Supreme    | Too sincere          |
| NFTs                    | JPGs              | No physical artifact |
| Sustainability Products | Bamboo everything | Tries too hard       |

**Terra Relics™ sits comfortably between joke and asset.**

---

## 9. Moat

* Brand voice
* Lore continuity
* Cultural timing
* Willingness to stop before it gets embarrassing

Replication is trivial.
Resonance is not.

## 10. Team

**Founder:** Brandon Neidlinger

* Builder of useful but undervalued things

Terra Relics™ is a mirror.
If you want in, ask yourself why.
